/**
    OpenAI GPT-3

    After the publicly available GPT and GPT-2 models (up to 1.5B) OpenAI created the much bigger GPT-3 (175B),
    but without sharing the trained parameters.

    GPT-3 was announced on 22 Sep 2020. Publication: https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165

    Difference to GPT-2:
      - Sparse decoders: Every second decoder uses local attention, using only the previous 256 tokens

public class GPT3
{
    // Not implemented, as no publicly available parameters, and almost identical to GPT-2
}
